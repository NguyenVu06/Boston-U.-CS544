##Part1) Binomial distribution (20 points)
Suppose a pitcher in Baseball has 50% chance of getting a strike-out when
throwing to a batter. Using the binomial distribution,
a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for striking out the next 6
batters.
b) Plot the CDF for the above
```{r Part 1a, 1b}
#x = strike, prob = 0.5, 
a <- dbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.5)
plot(0:6, a, type = "h", main = "50% chance strike-out PMF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-out", ylab = "PMF", ylim = c(0, 0.5))
abline(h=0)
points(0:6, a, pch = 16)


aC <- c(0,pbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.5))
aCDF <- stepfun(0:6, aC)
plot(aCDF, verticals = FALSE, pch = 16, main = "50% chance strike-out CDF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-out", ylab = "CDF", ylim = c(0, 1.1))

```

c) Repeat a) and b) if the pitcher has 70% chance of getting a strike-out.
d) Repeat a) and b) if the pitcher has 30% chance of getting a strike-out.
```{r Part 1c, 1d}
#x = strike, prob = 0.5, 
c <- dbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.7)
plot(0:6, c, type = "h",main = "70% chance strike out PMF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-outs", ylab = "PMF", ylim = c(0, 0.5))
abline(h=0)

cC <- c(0, pbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.7))
cCDF <- stepfun(0:6, cC)
plot(cCDF, verticals = FALSE,  pch = 16 ,main = "70% chance strike out CDF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-outs", ylab = "CDF", ylim = c(0, 1.1))


d <- dbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.3)
plot(0:6, d, type = "h", main = "30% chance strike out PMF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-outs", ylab = "PMF", ylim = c(0, 0.5))
abline(h=0)

dC <- c(0, pbinom(0:6, size = 6, prob = 0.3))
dCDF <- stepfun(0:6, dC)
plot(dCDF, verticals = FALSE, pch = 16, main = "30% chance strike out CDF plot", xlab = "# of Strike-outs", ylab = "CDF", ylim = c(0, 1.1))

```
e) Infer from the shape of the distributions.
The PMF plots shows the probability density of the binomial function base on the chance of striking out. When the chance of striking-out is 50%, the PDF plot resembles a normal distribution. When the chance of striking-out change to 30%, the PDF is right-skewed, and vice versa, when the chance of striking-out increase to 70%, the PDF becomes left skewed. Intuitively, this make sense, if we define the probability of sucess (p) equals strikingout, when p is lower than 50% such as 30%, the probability of "sucess" should be lower at 1, 2 and 3 than at 4, 5 and 6. The reverse is true for when p is higher than 50% such as 70%. When p equals to 50%, we would expect a normal shape distribution as we expect for equal probability of having strikeout a high number of batter and low number of batter. 
Comparing the CDF plots, when p = 50%, the lines for the step plots are move symetrical in step size with the largest steps in the middle. At p = 30% there are more probability that there are less than 4 strike out. The steps are bigger towards the lower values of strike out and much more closer together towards the higher number of strike-outs. The reverse of this is true for p = 70% as the step size are larger towards the higher number of strike-outs.
